# Introduction

Welcome to my QuillCTF Write-Up Repository!

## About QuillCTF
I am currently participating in [QuillCTF](https://www.quillaudits.com/academy/ctf), a thrilling Capture The Flag (CTF) competition that challenges web3 security researcher and smart contract auditors to test their skills in security domains. This repository is a collection of my write-ups and solutions for the challenges I have encountered during the QuillCTF practice.

## What's Inside
This repository serves as a record of my journey through QuillCTF, detailing the steps I took to solve different challenges, the tools and techniques I used, and the thought processes behind each solution. Whether you're a fellow competitor looking for hints or someone interested in learning more about Web3 security and CTFs, I hope you find this repository informative and engaging.

Feel free to explore the write-ups, ask questions, and share your insights. Let's learn and grow together in the exciting world of Web3sec!

Happy hacking!
